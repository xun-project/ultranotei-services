# UltraNoteI Services
UltraNoteI services offered through a simple API. 

# Chart API-s

Currently there are 3 chart API calls supported that return PNG images as result. The calls have the following endpoints:

* /charts/price.png -> Price history for the UltraNoteI coin
* /charts/volume.png -> Volume history for the UltraNoteI coin
* /charts/marketcap.png -> Marketcap history for the UltraNoteI coin

The type chart you get back depends on the parameters you pass in the URL.
